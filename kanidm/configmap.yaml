    #   The log level of the server. May be default, verbose, perfbasic, perffull
    #   Defaults to "default"
    log_level = "verbose"
    #
    #   The DNS domain name of the server. This is used in a number of security-critical contexts
    #   such as webauthn, so it *must* match your DNS hostname. It is what is used to create
    #   security principal names such as `william@idm.example.com` so that in a (future)
    #   trust configuration it is possible to have unique spn's throughout the topology.
    #   ⚠️  WARNING ⚠️
    #   Changing this value WILL break many types of registered credentials for accounts
    #   including but not limited to webauthn, oauth tokens, and more.
    #   If you change this value you *must* run `kanidmd domain_name_change` immediately
    #   after.

    #
    #   The origin for webauthn. This is the url to the server, with the port included if
    #   it is non-standard (any port except 443). This must match or be a descendent of the
    #   domain name you configure above. If these two items are not consistent, the server
    #   WILL refuse to start!

    #
    #   The role of this server. This affects features available and how replication may interact.
    #   Valid roles are:
    #   - WriteReplica
    #     This server provides all functionality of Kanidm. It allows authentication, writes, and
    #     the web user interface to be served.
    #   - WriteReplicaNoUI
    #     This server is the same as a WriteReplica, but does NOT offer the web user interface.
    #   - ReadOnlyReplica
    #     This server will not writes initiated by clients. It supports authentication and reads,
    #     and must have a replication agreement as a source of it's data.
    #   Defaults to "WriteReplica".
    # role = "WriteReplica"
    #
    # [online_backup]
    #   The path to the output folder for online backups
    # path = "/var/lib/kanidm/backups/"
    #   The schedule to run online backups - see https://crontab.guru/
    #   every day at 22:00 UTC (default)
    # schedule = "00 22 * * *"
    #    four times a day at 3 minutes past the hour, every 6th hours
    # schedule = "03 */6 * * *"
    #   Number of backups to keep (default 7)
    # versions = 7
